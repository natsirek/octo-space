Hello my name is Tristan and this is my language filter.
I go by the online tag of Grindleballs however if I were to  type the word balls it will be filtered out below.
Sometimes people try to curse by using different characters such as b!tch and sometimes using underlines a_s_s 
as you can see below my filter does not allowsuch things and can be changed and updated. 
As more updates come out for this dumbass filter the button depicted as "File" in the top left hand corner allows the user to refresh the filtures and increases the ever growing list of profanities.
I feel that highlighting the filtured out words allows the user after copying and pasting text into this section to clearly see if the message or text file they are reading is abusive or not.
FULL CAPS RAGE MODE IS NOT FILTERED AS OF YET
